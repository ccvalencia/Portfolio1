   <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Red'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">About Me</h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> Hello, I am Claudia. I was born in December 16, 2000 and I am 16 years old. I love going to downtown San Jose and Campbell to try out new things or just to look whats new . I'm going to be a Junior at Cristo Rey San Jose this upcoming school year. I enjoy trying out new things and I am always looking for an adventure. I love hiking and going to new places. I have five members in my family: my twin, my nine-year-old sister, and my parents. Fun Fact! I have family members that are  also twins, so I have aunts, grandparents, and cousins that are twins too. My favorite foods are tacos, enchiladas, tortas and pupusas. My favorite colors are yellow, black, pink and purple. I don't necessarily have pets, but I do own like 15 chickens. I wished that I wouldn't sacrafice my pet for dinner, but oh well.  :( </p>
  
   
    <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Orange'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Dislikes</h1>
   <p style="font-family:ariel;"> I hate animal prints like on clothes, shoes, backpacks, etc. I also HATE mayonnaise, I can't stand it. Not only that, but I also dislike crowds, missing my plane, humid-hot days, things with small holes, and much more.  </p>
   
   <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Yellow'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Reflection #1 </h1>
    <p style="font-family:ariel;">The similarities between pyton and scratch is that both use similar functions like variables, conditionals, loop, Boolean, and conditionals. They are both very alike. Some differences are that Python uses data types and things like that.. I really liked how today we used how to use adobe Photoshop- very fun to learn. Today. My partner April and I worked on Atom and it was so much fun. It was a bit of challenge because you couldn't make a single mistake or the program wouldn't let you run the code. It was fun figuring out ways to make shapes with colors.I feel proud of our program, it came out looking pretty cool. 
 
   
   <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Green'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Reflection #2</h1>
  <p style="font-family:ariel;"> Today we learned about robots and the great impact it has. They can be very useful and they are pretty cool. Robots are cool and I am very excited to learn more about robotics and the great things we can make. I really liked how we worked on groups on the circuit board project. It was it bit of a challenge but it was fun. </p>

   
   <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Cyan'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Reflection #3</h1>
   <p style="font-family:ariel;"> I learned that the internet is very fast and it is an amazing tool to use. Now I know what cookies are too. I always wondered what it meant. I believe LaTex is a programming language because many people use it write their code. </p>

     
     
     <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Blue'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Reflection #4</h1>
   <p style="font-family:ariel;"> I would also add more information to my Django site. I would like to add more features to my website and would love to learn about other cool things to add to a website. </p>

     
     <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Blue'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Reflection #5</h1>
   <p style="font-family:ariel;"> I know the internet is where all cool things happen and it happens in seconds. I also learned that a framework provides functionalities to a particular problem. I really enjoying learning about passwords and security.
   
   <h1 onmouseover="style.color='Purple'" onmouseout="style.color='White'">Hobbies</h1>
   <p style="font-family:ariel;">  My hobbies include: baking, cooking, running, reading, watching Netflix, going to record stores to find new music, hiking, and sleeping. I love listening to The Growlers, Mac DeMarco, Lana Del Rey, Coldplay, Nirvana, Logic, Lady Gaga, Big Sean, Twenty One Pilots, Imagine Dragons, Lorde, Mana, Enrique Iglesias, Chris Price, Sia, Rihanna, Maroon 5, Kanye West, Katy Perry and Beyonce! </p>
